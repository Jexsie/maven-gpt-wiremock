{"result":"To migrate away from Sonatype Aether in Maven projects, the following steps need to be taken:\n\n1. Remove all dependencies on org.sonatype.aether from the project. This includes removing any direct dependencies as well as checking for any transitive dependencies that might still be pulling in the old Sonatype dependencies.\n\n2. Search for any imports of org.sonatype.aether in the Java source code and replace them with the corresponding classes from org.eclipse.aether. Most classes can be easily replaced, but special attention should be given to classes like org.sonatype.aether.impl.internal.SimpleLocalRepositoryManager, which is no longer available in Maven Resolver.\n\n3. Update the dependencies in the project's pom.xml file. For example, if the project previously had dependencies like:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.sonatype.aether</groupId>\n    <artifactId>aether-connector-file</artifactId>\n    <scope>test</scope>\n</dependency>\n```\nThey should be replaced with:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.maven.resolver</groupId>\n    <artifactId>maven-resolver-transport-file</artifactId>\n    <version>1.4.1</version>\n    <scope>test</scope>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n4. Ensure that all dependencies with the group ID org.sonatype.aether or org.eclipse.aether are removed from the project's pom.xml. The project should only import dependencies from org.apache.maven.resolver after the migration is complete.\n\n5. It is important to update any legacy Maven plugin code that interacts with Maven repositories using org.sonatype.aether to use the current APIs from Maven Resolver. This will involve updating artifacts, libraries, and dependencies to the new group ID org.apache.maven.resolver.\n\nBy following these steps, the project can successfully migrate away from Sonatype Aether to Apache Maven Resolver, ensuring compatibility with the latest Maven standards and best practices.","metadata":[{"url":"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/Migrating+from+org.sonatype.aether+to+Apache+Maven+Resolver"},{"url":"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/AetherClassNotFound"},{"url":"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/AetherClassNotFound?focusedCommentId=34025047"}],"messageStoreSize":9}
