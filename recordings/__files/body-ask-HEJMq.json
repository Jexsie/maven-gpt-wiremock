{"result":"The build POM and consumer POM are two different representations of a project's configuration in Apache Maven. The build POM is used during the build process and may contain advanced configurations, plugins, and dependencies specific to building the project. On the other hand, the consumer POM is a simplified version of the build POM that is meant for consumers of the project, making it easier to understand and use without the complexity of the build-specific details.\n\nThe build POM version may evolve with newer Maven versions, requiring updates to the build process, while the consumer POM remains compatible with the classical POM v4 standard. To achieve this separation, tools like the flatten-maven-plugin can generate a consumer POM from the original build POM, simplifying it for consumer use. This separation allows for clearer documentation and explanation of consumer features without the clutter of build-specific content.\n\nIn Maven 3.6.3, the ModelBuilder reads the POM file to create a raw model, which is then enriched to generate the effective model. However, starting from Maven 3.7.0, the ModelBuilder reads the file to create a file model, which is further processed using the BuildPomXMLFilter to create a consumer-friendly model. This merged model ensures that line numbers in the consumer POM match the original POM for easier reference and understanding.","metadata":[{"url":"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/Build+vs+Consumer+POM?focusedCommentId=75976498"},{"url":"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/Build+vs+Consumer+POM?focusedCommentId=75976526"},{"url":"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/Build+vs+Consumer+POM?focusedCommentId=75976520"},{"url":"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/Build+vs+Consumer+POM?focusedCommentId=75976553"},{"url":"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/Build+vs+Consumer+POM?focusedCommentId=75976458"}],"messageStoreSize":3}
